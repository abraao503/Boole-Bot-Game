# Boole-Bot-Game
Boole Bots is a game that is not only fun, but also an aid in helping to understand basic Boolean logic. This game has an arena of 8x8 game tiles in which your bots move at random speeds and trajectories. The Bots are assigned boolean values of 0 or 1 and boolean operations - AND, OR, NOR, NOT.
